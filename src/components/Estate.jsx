          The Spellworth estate, ensconced near the Scottish border in St.
          Alban, Yorkshire, exudes an aura of enchantment. Within its bounds,
          ancient forests teem with whispers of magic, and verdant hills dance
          with the echoes of mythical creatures. Decades past, the land trembled
          under the fiery tyranny of Zefirakiel, the legendary dragon. Yet,
          through valor and wizardry, the beast was vanquished, rendering the
          estate a haven of safety and wonder. Today, visitors tread upon
          enchanted paths, where every glade and glen bears testament to the
          enduring power of magic, woven into the very fabric of this mystical
          realm.
